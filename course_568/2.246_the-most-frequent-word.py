'''
Write a program that reads the text from the file (the file may contain more than one line) and outputs the most frequent
word in the text, and after a space - how many times it occurred. If there are several such words, output the first one
in a lexicographical order (you can use the < operator for the strings).

The words written in different registers (cases) are considered to be the same.

Sample Input:
    abc a bCd bC AbC BC BCD bcd ABC

Sample Output:
    abc 3
