'''
There are two HTML-pages â€“ A and B.
From A we can go to B in one step, if inside A there is a link to B, i.e. inside A there is a tag <a href="B">, possibly
with additional parameters inside the tag.
From A we can go to B in two steps, if there is such document C, that from A to C we can go in one step, and from C to B
we can go in one step.

On input your program gets two lines, containing the URLs to the two documents A and B.
Output Yes, if you can go from A to B for two steps, otherwise output No.

Please note that not all links inside the HTML pages can lead to an existing HTML pages.
